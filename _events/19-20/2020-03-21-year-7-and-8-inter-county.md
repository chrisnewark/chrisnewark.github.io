The situation regarding coronavirus is developing and there may soon be a requirement for public events to be curtailed and possibly schools to close.

Regretfully, but mindful of our duty of care to athletes, officials and spectators, KSAA has taken the decision to cancel this event.

KSAA is very aware of the disappointment this will cause selected athletes, but hopes you will understand the reasoning behind this action.
