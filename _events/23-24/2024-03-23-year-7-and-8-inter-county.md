#### Event Cancelled

It is with regret that Hampshire Schools have cancelled this meeting.

The enormous amount of rain has made the course and college grounds extremely wet. Access around the fields for the First Aid vehicle could be impossible and the necessary grass overflow parking area is now impossible to use.

This event will not be rescheduled.
