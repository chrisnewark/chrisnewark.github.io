This year's KSAA County Championships will be slightly different to previous editions, but we believe that it will remain Kent's premier schools athletics event providing opportunities to athletes schooled in the county to be crowned 'County Champion'. It will also represent a selection route for the South-East Schools' Inter-Counties (hosted by Surrey) on the 19th June. Both these events provide opportunities to attain an ESAA National Standard performance which will be required in order for KSAA to nominate any athlete for a possible invitation to compete at the ESAA T&F Championships in Manchester on 9th, 10th and 11th July. This event itself will be staged in a different format than ever before due to the continued impact of Covid 19.

<span style="color:red">We would like to make you aware of the significant changes to the KSAA Championship format for 2021:</span>

- There will be a full programme of ESAA events **including Senior** (Y12/13) events [to provide ESAA qualification opportunities] and Race Walks.
- Sadly, to accommodate Senior athletes, there will be no Y7 events in the 2021 championships.
- Athletes will be limited to **ONE EVENT** only
- **All track events** will be run as (seeded) graded finals.
- Competing athletes will be expected to achieve at least the district qualifying standard – a list of which will be published in due course.

<span style="color:red">The entry system will also be different for the 2021 season:</span>

- All entries will be completed on an electronic entry system and there will be a small entry fee to cover event costs – paid online.
- Entries will be accepted from individuals, via clubs/coaches or schools. However, as this is a school's event and you will need to state your school details when entering as you will be representing them at the championships.

<span style="color:red">Key dates:</span>

- Entry forms will be available from your school or on the KSAA, the KSAA Facebook page or KCAA website. Your clubs will also have access to entry forms which will be distributed in early April
- The deadline for entries will be Monday 24th May. This is later than normal (because of the current Covid restrictions) and so there will be strictly no late entries or event changes!

Please Note: The date of the Championships clashes with Day 1 of SEAA U20 Championships
