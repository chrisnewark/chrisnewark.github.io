We are very grateful to The Duke of York's School for hosting our event this year. As this is an M.O.D. site there are special requirements that must be adhered to. Please ensure you follow all the rules and requests of the school.

### Entry procedure

Entry for this event is by a district competition or nomination by your school to the district coordinator.

District coordinators are responsible for selection decisions and submitting entries.

All schools must be affiliated through their district to KSAA.

District coordinators must have entered their eligible athletes by 8th December 2017.

The names of all entered athletes will appear on the website from 11th-18th December 2017.

Districts may make adjustments to their team lists during this time.

No entries will be made after 18th December 2017.

All athletes should check their entry and if there is an issue, should contact their school P.E department in the first instance.

It is expected that eligible athletes will be proactive in ensuring they have been entered by the stated deadline.

No new entries will be allowed on the day of competition. If in doubt about your entry please check with your district co-ordinator before travelling.

### Parking

The security gate will be manned and there will be number plate recognition cameras in operation.

All cars will be directed to appropriate spaces, so please follow instructions from the stewards to ensure maximum use of the area.

Please allow sufficient time to park and register for your race as there may be some congestion at peak periods.

Cars are parked at owners' risk. KSAA accept no responsibility.

### Course

It is strongly advised that all competitors ensure they have suitable footwear for what may be heavy ground conditions.

### School Premises

The school will be in session with lessons and activities throughout the day so registration, course, toilets and refreshments are in a defined area. **ALL OTHER AREAS ARE OUT OF BOUNDS. PLEASE DO NOT STRAY.**

Adhere to speed limits in the school grounds and be aware of children on the roads.

Do not climb on or use the assault structures in the start field.

Make every effort to keep the school site clean and as free from mud as possible. This also includes the car park.

It would be very helpful if competitors and spectators bring a change of footwear.

No dogs allowed on the school site.

### Cancellation of event

If this becomes necessary, all district co-ordinators will be informed and a notice will be put on the website by Thursday 18th January 2018.
