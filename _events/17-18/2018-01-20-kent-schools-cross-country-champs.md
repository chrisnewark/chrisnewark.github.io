All schools must be affiliated through their district to KSAA.

District coordinators must have entered their eligible athletes by 8th December 2017.

The names of all entered athletes will appear on the website from 11th-18th December 2017.

Districts may make adjustments to their team lists during this time.

No entries will be made after 18th December 2017.

All athletes should check their entry and if there is an issue, should contact their school P.E department in the first instance.

It is expected that eligible athletes will be proactive in ensuring they have been entered by the stated deadline.

No new entries will be allowed on the day of competition. If in doubt about your entry please check with your district co-ordinator before travelling.

#### Parking

#### Course

It is strongly advised that all competitors ensure they have suitable footwear for what may be heavy ground conditions.
