#### Parking

There is adequate parking at the school, but it is likely that not all cars will be accommodated. There will be some congestion during the day so please allow extra time. It is hoped stewards will be available to help, but please park carefully and with consideration for school property and local residents.

Cars are parked at owners' risk. KSAA accept no responsibility.
