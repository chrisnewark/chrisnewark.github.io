The course will be run over the north-western car and caravan parking area, known as the "Airfield" and is accessed directly from the A20 Gorse Hill entrance and **not** via the Main Circuit entrance.

There will be a parking charge of &#163;3 per car.

The course is open and relatively flat around the start/finish and parking area, but with a hill on the lower part of the course. Athletes are strongly advised to familiarise themselves with the course before competing.

The venue does not have any changing or fixed toilet facilities.

#### The Course

The courses are almost entirely on grass, with only a couple of gravel tracks to be crossed. After heavy rain the gravel tracks will have literally 3-4 inches of water in them. The grass seems to drain very well. The top area where the Start/Finish etc. are located, is flat and fast, but the course does drop down to the NW corner, and there is a 500m gradual climb back up. The area is very exposed, almost no shelter, so winds can be chilling.
