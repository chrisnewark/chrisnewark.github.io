All cars will be directed to appropriate spaces so please follow instructions from the stewards.

#### School site

Registration, course, toilets, refreshments will all be in a defined area. All other areas are out of bounds and it is imperative that visitors do not stray into any other parts of the site as lessons and various activities will be underway throughout the day.

No dogs should be brought to this event as they will not be allowed on site.

Please allow sufficient time to park and register for your race as there may be some congestion at peak times.
