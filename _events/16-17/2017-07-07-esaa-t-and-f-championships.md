## Selection Criteria

A maximum of 70 male and female athletes will be selected from the Junior, Intermediate and Senior age groups to represent the Kent Schools Athletic Association at the English Schools Track and Field Championships.

It is expected that selected athletes will have achieved the **ESAA National Standard** in at least one of the Championships listed below.

- Kent County Championships
- Kent Schools' Championships
- Schools Inter - County Competition
- SEAA Age group Championships

Athletes not reaching the National Standard can still gain selection by achieving the ESAA entry standard in one or more of the above championships, although this does not guarantee selection.

Indoor performances, Open Meetings, League Matches and BMC Races are rarely considered as evidence for selection and only in exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the KSAA Selection Committee would an athlete be selected with performances from outside the main championships (see Senior athletes below).

    <p>
        Due to more restricted opportunities for Senior athletes, qualifying times / distances will be considered from recognised Championships and a wider range of events.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Senior</strong> athletes should also complete a nomination form and return it on or before the date of the Kent Schools' Track and Field Championships.
