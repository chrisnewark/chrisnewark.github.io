Entries must be made by the district co-ordinators by 5pm on Friday 12 th May 2017. The names of all entered athletes will appear on the KSAA website from Wednesday 17th May  2017. Amendments may be made via district co-ordinators only between the 17th and 21st May after which no changes or entries will be accepted.

Competitors may be entered in no more than two events and as per UKA rules may not run in the 800m with 1500m or 3000m, or 1500m with 3000m. Please note certain 'unusual' combinations of events may lead to a clash in timetabling.

**It is expected that athletes have attained at least ESAA district standards (DS)** especially in events such as High Jump where a minimum start height will apply. See [ESAA 2017 Standards](/files/events/16-17/2017-06-10-kent-schools-t-and-f-championships/ESAA-T-F-Standards-2017.xlsx).

**There will be no Senior events except for STEEPLECHASE (Boys - 2000m/Girls 1500m), as opportunities to compete over chase are limited. Those wishing to enter the steeplechase should contact Iain Presnell direct on ijkl.presnell@btopenworld.com or 07549 175229.**
Senior athletes who wish to be considered for selection to the Kent Schools' team must be nominated on a separate form via their district. The form is also available on this website and should be received by Saturday 10th June.

Competitors must wear vest and shorts (or equivalent clothing) in District colours or other approved clothing, such as club or school vests.
